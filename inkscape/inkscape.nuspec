    <description><![CDATA[
Inkscape is an open source drawing tool with capabilities similar to
Illustrator, Freehand, and CorelDRAW that uses the W3C standard scalable
vector graphics format (SVG). Some supported SVG features include
basic shapes, paths, text, markers, clones, alpha blending, transforms,
gradients, and grouping. In addition, Inkscape supports Creative Commons
meta-data, node-editing, layers, complex path operations, text-on-path,
and SVG XML editing. It also imports several formats like EPS, Postscript,
JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF and exports PNG as well as multiple vector-based
formats.

Inkscape's main motivations are to provide the Open Source community
with a fully W3C compliant XML, SVG, and CSS2 drawing tool emphasizing a
lightweight core with powerful features added as extensions, and the
establishment of a friendly, open, community-oriented development
processes.
