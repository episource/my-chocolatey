Virtually all of standard XnView's much loved features have been preserved in XnView MP and many features have actually been tweaked and enhanced.

## Optimized Performance
Considerable improvements have been made in terms of performance (speed-optimized loading, improved caching, multi-core processing, 64bits version, etc...)

## Multi-Platform
Windows, Mac OS X and Linux are now supported in both 32 and 64 bit versions
