    <description>Subtree2 is a merge strategy for git similiar to the built-in subtree strategy. Additionally, subtree2 has the ability to merge subdirectories of the source branch, too. Like the default subtree strategy it can also merge to subdirectories of the target branch.

The merge strategy is accompanied by a utility script called subproject, that can be used for pulling a subdirectory of a different branch or repository into a subdirectory of the target/current branch. It merges using `--squash`, so that the history does not become cluttered. Source branch and commit are remembered within the merge commit's message to simplify later updates. A subproject can also be merged back into the source branch.
