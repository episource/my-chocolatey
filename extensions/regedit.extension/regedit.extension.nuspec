    <releaseNotes>
v3.0.7   - Suppress "True"/"False" to be written to the console without context
           when uninstalling a registry image
v3.0.6   - Properly handle paths containing wildcard (-LiteralPath option has
           been added to Test-Path)
v3.0.5   - Fix Split-RegistryPath: preserve path separator after drive spec
v3.0.4   - Fix Edit-AllLocalUserProfileHives not to fail when there's only one
           local user profile
v3.0.3   - Fix _Uninstall-RegistryImageImpl to use the literal path instead of
           expanding globs
         - Fix the uninstall command created by the auto-uninstall feature
           of Install-UserProfileRegistryImage
v3.0.2   - Fix New-RegistryKey to use the literal path instead of expanding
           globs
         - Fix uninstall cmdlets to use the literal key path instead of
           expanding globs
         - Test-RegistryPathValidity now distinguishes between absolute paths
           (Type=Absolute) including registry hives (like HKCU:\) and absolute
           paths excluding registry hives (Type=AbsoluteNoHives)
         - Fix several cmdlets to evaluate the return value of 
           Test-RegistryPathValidity (instead of relying on the default
           ErrorAction)
         - Fix _Import-RegistryImpl and _Uninstall-RegistryImageImpl to expect
           absolute paths when no parent key has been specified
         - Make Edit-AllLocalUserProfileHives propagate exceptions that occured
           during invocation of the action callback
v3.0.1   - Make cmdlet Edit-AllLocalUserProfileHives usable outside the regedit
           module: Until now the variable `$hkuPath has not been accessible
           outside module scope
v3.0.0   - Fix exporting of (Default) registry entries
         - Fix filtering registry entries to be exported
         - Add support for filtering registry entries using powershell regular
           expressions
         - Handle non-existing paths gracefully
v2.1.0   - Add a cmdlet for merging registry images
v2.0.0   - Read registry image from pipeline
         - Make Test-RegistryPathValidity accept PSDrives again
v1.2.0   - Format powershell byte arrays using hex notation
v1.1.1   - Stop Export-Registry to write 'true' to the pipeline as first item
v1.1.0   - Export Edit-AllLocalUserProfileHives cmdlet
v1.0.0.1 - Important bug fixes - no functional changes
v1.0.0   - Initial version
