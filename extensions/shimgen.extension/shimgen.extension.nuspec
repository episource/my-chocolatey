    <releaseNotes>
- v2.0.0 - breaking change: file patterns are matched against an executable's
           path relative to the current package directory (e. g.
           C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\shimgen.extension); the previous
           behavior was to match against the absolute path
- v1.0.1 - Fix ?-wildcard which did not match the documentation
- v1.0.0 - Initial version
