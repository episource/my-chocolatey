MALWARE WARNING:

The installer "SetupImgBurn_$version.exe" tries to install adware/malware. It
does so only if the user accepts installing additional software, but it tries
hard to make the user accept this in one of serveral ways.

This chocolatey package does not actually install imgburn using its setup.
Instead the setup binary is extracted only. There's a slight risk, that the
author decides to add malware to the main binaries, but currently only the
installer is affected.

In this special case the downloaded exe is not stored in the nupkg, but already
extracted at build-time.
